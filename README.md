# Cricket-Camp-Membership-Organizer

A multi-page Java application for managing cricket camp memberships and tournament registrations.

## 📖About:
The program will aid in the organization of member information and tournament details for a cricket camp through two interconnected portals (one for the organizer and one for the members/ players). Both types of users will have the ability to edit player details with their unique login credentials. The organizer can add, edit, and remove players and their dues. Players can select their jersey numbers and register for tournaments, but will be assigned a spot based on priority, and teams will be randomly generated to prevent biased formations. This program makes communication between the organizer and members more efficient and organized, while maintaing a user-freindly interface.
